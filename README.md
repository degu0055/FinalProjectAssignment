# FinalProjectAssignment


## 1. Scenario Description:
<!-- Provide an overview of the Rideau Canal Skateway monitoring scenario and explain the problem your solution addresses. -->

## 2. System Architecture:
<!-- Include a clear diagram illustrating the data flow:
- IoT sensors pushing simulated data to Azure IoT Hub.
- Azure Stream Analytics processing the incoming data.
- Processed data being stored in Azure Blob Storage. -->

## 3. Implementation Details:
<!-- IoT Sensor Simulation:
- Describe how the simulated IoT sensors generate and send data to Azure IoT Hub.
- Include the structure of the JSON payload and any scripts or applications used. -->

Azure IoT Hub Configuration:
<!-- - Explain the configuration steps for setting up the IoT Hub, including endpoints and message routing. -->

Azure Stream Analytics Job:
<!-- - Describe the job configuration, including input sources, query logic, and output destinations.
- Provide sample queries used for data processing. -->

Azure Blob Storage:
<!-- - Explain how the processed data is organized in Blob Storage (e.g., folder structure, file naming convention).
- Specify the formats of stored data (JSON/CSV). -->

## 4. Usage Instructions:
<!-- Running the IoT Sensor Simulation:
- Provide step-by-step instructions for running the simulation script or application. -->

Configuring Azure Services:
<!-- - Describe how to set up and run the IoT Hub and Stream Analytics job. -->

Accessing Stored Data:
<!-- - Include steps to locate and view the processed data in Azure Blob Storage. -->

## 5. Results:
<!-- Highlight key findings, such as:
- Aggregated data outputs (e.g., average ice thickness).

Include references to sample output files stored in Blob Storage. -->

## 6. Reflection:
<!-- Discuss any challenges faced during implementation and how they were addressed. -->
